Hello

ChrisC2592 here, I am a beginner in programming. I have taken a few introductory classes on different programming languages
such as Java, JavaScript, Python and two classes on HTML5 and CSS.

I like Yu-Gi-Oh

Not very good at speaking or typing in this case oh and can ramble on, go off on tangents, etc.
